# Contributing to RADIS 

We love spectroscopy, and we love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code or the physics
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features (interface or physics)
- Becoming a core developer

This document is a quick summary, more information can be found on the [Developer Guide](https://radis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/developer.html) 

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We (try to) use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
So all code changes (should) happen through Pull Requests. 
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've added new features, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Open that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/radis/radis/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

Issues labeled [Good First Issue](https://github.com/radis/radis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
are also a nice way to get started with contributing to the project. 

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. Not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We're using the Black coding style. See the [Developer Guide](https://radis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/developer.html#code-linting) 
for more information.
