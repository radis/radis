Example #3: non-equilibrium spectrum (Tvib, Trot, x_CO)
================================================================================

With the new fitting module introduced in :py:func:`~radis.tools.new_fitting.fit_spectrum` function,
and in the example of Tgas fitting using new fitting module, we can see its 1-temperature fitting
performance for equilibrium condition.

This example features how new fitting module can fit non-equilibrium spectrum, with multiple fit
parameters, such as vibrational/rotational temperatures, or mole fraction, etc.

This is a real fitting case introduced Grimaldi's thesis: https://doi.org/10.2514/1.T6768 .
This case features CO molecule emitting on a wide range of spectrum. This case also includes
a user-defined trapezoid slit function, which is accounted by the distortion (dispersion) of the slit,
as a result of the influences from experimental parameters and spectrometer dispersion parameters
during the experiment.
