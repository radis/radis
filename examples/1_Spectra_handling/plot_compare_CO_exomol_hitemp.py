=========================================================
Compare CO cross-sections from HITRAN, HITEMP, GEISA, and ExoMol
=========================================================

Auto-download and calculate CO spectrum from the HITRAN, HITEMP, GEISA, and ExoMol databases.
ExoMol references multiple databases for CO. Here we do not
use the ExoMol recommended database (see :py:func:`~radis.io.exomol.get_exomol_database_list`)
but we use the HITEMP database hosted on ExoMol.

Output should be similar, but no! By default these ExoMol does not provide
broadening coefficients for air. However, the Einstein coefficients & linestrengths
should be the same, therefore the integrals under the lines should be similar.

We verify this below :

For further exploration, ExoMol and HITEMP lines can be downloaded and accessed separately using
:py:func:`~radis.io.exomol.fetch_exomol` and :py:func:`~radis.io.hitemp.fetch_hitemp`
