===============================
Calculate a full range spectrum
===============================

We compute the transmittance of an homogeneous, 1-km atmosphere layer
at 300 K and 1 atm, with 2% H2O.

This example makes use of a lot of the RADIS optimization and convenience functions :

- The database is retrieved from the latest HITRAN data using [HAPI]_, parsed
  with RADIS and stored to memory-mapping formats. After the first calls,
  retrieving the database will be very fast

- The RADIS algorithm includes a sparse wavenumber implementation, which is
  activated by default in the following example where the waverange is very
  large. This behavior can be changed by setting the `SPARSE_WAVENUMBER` key
  of the :py:attr:`radis.config` dictionary, or of the ~/radis.json user file.

- The wavenumber grid is automatically computed using the `wstep='auto'` parameter.

- A linestrength cutoff reduces the initial number of lines.

Eventually, the full-range spectrum (about 4.8M points) is computed within a minute,
with about 140k lines resolved, i.e. a performance of about 1e10 gridpoints*lines/s.

Extra optimization could be achieved by cutting the spectrum in small intervals,
but requires an a-priori knowledge of the absorption & emission ranges of the
spectrum. See the :ref:`Calculate a large spectrum by part <example_large_range_by_part>`
