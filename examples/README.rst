===============

These examples show simple calculations and tasks
that can be done with the RADIS package.

Other examples can be found in the dedicated
`radis-examples <https://github.com/radis/radis-examples>`__
repository.


All examples can be run online, without any install required:

- Download the Jupyter notebook  `.ipynb` in the example page.

- start `Radis-Lab <https://radis.github.io/radis-lab/>`__,
  upload the Jupyter notebook, and run it from there.


.. note::

    Radis-Lab allows you to share your session URL with colleagues.
    They will access the latest saved version of your notebook as long
    as your session is running.
