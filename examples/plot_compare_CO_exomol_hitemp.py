=========================================================
Compare CO xsections from the ExoMol and HITEMP database
=========================================================

Auto-download and calculate CO spectrum from the HITEMP database, and the
ExoMol database. ExoMol references multiple databases for CO. Here we do not
use the ExoMol recommended database (see :py:func:`~radis.io.exomol.get_exomol_database_list`)
but we use the HITEMP database hosted on ExoMol.

Output should be similar, but no ! By default these two databases provide
different broadening coefficients. However, the Einstein coefficients & linestrengths
should be the same, therefore the integrals under the lines should be similar.

We verifiy this below :

For further exploratino, ExoMol and HITEMP lines can be downloaded and accessed separately using
:py:func:`~radis.io.exomol.fetch_exomol` and :py:func:`~radis.io.hitemp.fetch_hitemp`
