Features
========


RADIS is both an infrared :ref:`line-by-line code <label_line_by_line>` 
and a :ref:`post-processing library <label_spectrum>`. 
It includes: 

- Absorption and emission spectra of all [HITRAN-2016]_ species under equilibrium calculations (:py:data:`~radis.io.MOLECULES_LIST_EQUILIBRIUM`)
- Absorption and emission spectra of CO2 and CO for nonequilibrium calculations (see :py:data:`~radis.io.MOLECULES_LIST_NONEQUILIBRIUM` )
- Different Line Databases: support of [HITRAN-2016]_, [HITEMP-2010]_ and [CDSD-4000]_ line databases (see :py:data:`~radis.lbl.loader.KNOWN_DBFORMAT`) 
- Calculation of :ref:`Rovibrational Energies of molecules <label_examples_rovibrational_energies>`. 
- Calculation of equilibrium and nonequilibrium :ref:`Partition Functions <label_examples_partition_functions>`. 
- Spatially heterogeneous spectra (see :ref:`see line-of-sight <label_los_index>`)
- Post-processing tools to load and :ref:`compare with experimental spectra <label_spectrum_howto_compare>` (see :ref:`the Spectrum object <label_spectrum>`)
- A :ref:`Line Survey <label_spectrum_linesurvey>` tool to identify which lines correspond to a spectral feature.

RADIS does *not* include, so far: 

- Line-mixing effects and speed-dependant lineshapes. [HAPI]_ is a Python alternative that does it. 
- Collisional-induced absorption (CIA) or emission. 
- Electronic states other than electronic ground states
- Hamiltonian calculations (a private module for CO2 is available `on request <mailto:erwan.pannier@gmail.com>`__)
- Raman spectra (contribute in `#43 <https://github.com/radis/radis/issues/43>`__)

RADIS also features: 

- :ref:`High Performances <label_lbl_performance>`: spectra are calculated up to several orders of magnitude faster than equivalent line-by-line codes. 
- Automatic testing and continuous integration tools for a reliable :ref:`Open-source Development <label_developer_guide>`. 
- In-the-browser `Online Calculations <https://github.com/radis/radis-examples#interactive-examples>`_ (no install needed). 

Remarks and request for features can be done on `GitHub <https://github.com/radis/radis/issues>`__ ,

Use Cases
---------

Use RADIS to: 

- Quickly compare different line databases: 
  Various line database formats are supported by RADIS, and can be easily switched
  to be compared. See the list of supported line databases formats: 
  :py:data:`~radis.lbl.loader.KNOWN_DBFORMAT`
  and refer to the :ref:`Configuration file <label_lbl_config_file>` on how to use them. 

  See the comparison of two CO2 spectra calculated with [HITEMP-2010]_ and [CDSD-4000]_ 
  below:

      :alt: https://radis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/cdsd4000_vs_hitemp_3409K.svg


- Use the RADIS post-processing methods with the calculation results of another spectral code. For instance, 
  `pySpecair <https://spectralfit.gitlab.io/specair/>`__, the Python interface to `SPECAIR <http://www.specair-radiation.net/>`__,
  uses the RADIS :py:class:`~radis.spectrum.spectrum.Spectrum` object for post-processing 
  (see :ref:`How to generate a Spectrum? <label_howto_generate_spectrum>`)
  
  
Refer to the :ref:`Examples <label_examples>` section for more examples, or to 
the `RADIS Interactive Examples <https://github.com/radis/radis-examples#interactive-examples>`_ project. 




See the :ref:`Architecture <label_dev_architecture>` section for an overview of the RADIS calculation 
steps.
