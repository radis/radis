    ----------

    wavelength: array-like (nm)

    Note
    ----

    Not exactly true, as air_index_dispersion is defined for vacuum wavelength
    However, air_index_dispersion doesnt vary much on 1-2 cm-1 (which is typical
    of air index dispersion effect on air/vacuum wavelength in the mid-IR)

    Estimate the error you make with::

        vacuum2air(air2vacuum(w))-w
